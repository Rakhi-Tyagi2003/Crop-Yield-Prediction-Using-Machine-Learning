                                                Crop Yield Prediction Using Machine Learning


## Project Overview
This Project predicts crop yield based on various agricultural factors using Mschine Learning techniques.
It helps farmers and stakeholders make data - driven decisions to improve agricultural productivity.

## Project Statement
Farmers often face uncertainity in predicting crop yield due to changing environmental and soil conditions.
This project uses historical data and machine learning algorithm to predict crop yield accurately.

## Tech Stack
